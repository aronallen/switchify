#Switchify

Switchify is a jQuery plugin that emulates a switch from UIKit in WebKit/Gecko.

It uses jQuery Data to store it's options and elements, these are name spaced switchify:options and switchify:elements, respectivly, and can be accessed if you need to.

If you need to manipulate any options, do so by calling Switchify again, and pass in the differing options.

##Known issues

WebKit has a border-radius clipping bug on rounded elements, therefor I animate the 'margin-left' CSS property if the switch parameter 'rounded' is 'true' on WebKit.

The 'margin-left' parameter is not a hardware accelerated animation, therefore I suggest you use the square version of the switch, if you want the switch to behave naturally in WebKit on iOS.

The CSS property that is chosen for the transition are as follows:
traslate3d(x , 0, 0) //except on WebKit with 'rounded' : true
translateX(x) // except on WebKit with 'rounded' : true.
margin-left // fallback for older browsers           

##Parameters

Switchify accepts two parameters, the first parameter is the options parameter.
                                


###Options

- size: 44, //the height of the switch, the width is calculated from this value depending on the string lengths
- strings:
	- on: "ON", //the label shown when the switch is on.
	- off: "OFF", //the label shown when the switch is off.
- state: true, //the state of the switch (accces this value externally by $(element).data('switchify:options').state)
- shading: true, //whether to apply shading on the switch or not (gradients and box-shadows)
- rounded: true, //whether to round the corners of the switch.
- clickable: true //whether the user can click the switch, instead of dragging it.
                                                                                                                                       
###Callback
          
The second parameter is a callback parameter, it is called each time the user has stopped interacting, and the animations have ended.  

function(state){
		console.log(state);
}
