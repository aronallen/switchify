#Switchify

Switchify is a jQuery plugin that emulates a switch from UIKit in WebKit/Gecko.

It uses jQuery Data to store it's options and elements, these are name spaced switchify:options and switchify:elements, respectivly, and can be accessed if you need to. 

##Parameters

Switchify accepts two parameters, the first parameter is the options parameter.

Here are the default options

- size: 44, //the height of the switch, the width is calculated from this value depending on the string lengths
- strings:
	- on: "ON", //the label shown when the switch is on.
	- off: "OFF", //the label shown when the switch is off.
- state: true, //the state of the switch (accces this value externally by $(element).data('switchify:options').state)
- shading: true, //whether to apply shading on the switch or not (gradients and box-shadows)
- rounded: true, //whether to round the corners of the switch.
- clickable: true //whether the user can click the switch, instead of dragging it.

The second parameter is a callback parameter, it is called each time the user has stopped interacting, and the animations have ended.  

Here is a callback example:

function(state){
		console.log(state);
}
